# FAISS-Recommendation

# üéØ Event Recommendation System using FAISS and Sentence Transformers

An efficient, scalable content-based event recommendation system. It fetches event data from a **Supabase PostgreSQL database**, encodes the event content using **Sentence Transformers**, and builds a **FAISS vector index** to allow real-time semantic similarity search.
